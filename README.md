# Python API Homework

## Part I - WeatherPy

Observations

* In the northern hemisphere, there is a strong correlation between latitude and max temperature. The highest temperaturess occur between 
0 and 20 degrees north. There is a clear inverse relationship between temperature and latitude: temperatures steadily decrease 
with increasing latitude.

* In the southern hemisphere, there is a positive correlation between latitude and temperature: as latitude increases, temperatures also
increase. The correlation is not as strong as it is in the north, but the trend is evident. Temperatures are greatest from 0 to -15 degrees.

* There is no correlation between humidity and latitude, cloudiness and latitude, or wind speed and latitude, either in the northern or
southern hemispheres.


## Part II - VacationPy

The resulting data requested from the weather API is saved in a CSV file in the "data" folder.

A screenshot of the map of hotels in vacation destination cities is included in the repo, as well.
